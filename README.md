**The second version of my Terrain Generation project, *1st version used in Ecosystem Simulation NEA***

### What makes this different?
I couldnt find any large scale terrain generation projects / tutorials that were low poly and also had advanced capabilities like biomes etc - Hence I built this.

### New Features
- Infinite Terrain
- Better biome generation + Better variety of heightmaps for different biomes
- Uses unity URP to make it look better
- Much better written

### Future
I plan to implement this into a 2nd version of my ecosystem simulation though slightly less focused on evolution and instead just having infinite terrain with animals populating it.
